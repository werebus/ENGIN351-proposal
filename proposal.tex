\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introduction}
  This proposal is in to response to request number 2014-04, a request for
  engineering students to perform as-needed technical writing services.  In
  the following slides, I will lay out my educational and profesional
  background and present the capibilities and experience that I feel make me
  an good choice for this project.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Educational Background}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Educational Background}

  I have a strong background in both transportation engineering and computer
  science.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item B.S. Civil and Environmental Engineering \\
      Concentration in Transportation Engineering
    \item Minor in Computer Science
    \item Certificate in Transit Operations Management
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Profesional Background}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Profesional Background}

  I am currently employed with UMass Transit Services as an IT Systems Engineer,
  and have conducted many professional correspondences in that capacity.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Worked in IT for the last seven years
    \item Worked in transit management for the last ten years
    \item Been involved in the daily operation of the transit system for the
      last thirteen years
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Qualifications}

  \frametitle{Qualifications}
  I have a number of qualifications that will be required over the course of
  this project. They are\ldots
\end{frame}

\subsection{Profesional Corespondence}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Proficient With a Variety of Profesional Correspondence}
  In the course of my professional and educational career, I have become
  proficient with a variety of forms of professional corresempondence,
  including, but mot limited to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Summaries
    \item Technical Memos
    \item Emails
    \item Posters
    \item Process Descriptions
    \item Instruction Sets
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Data Awareness}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conscious of the Importance of Clear and Accurate Data}
  As an engineer, I'm very conscious of the need to be able to present data in
  a way that is clear, unambiguous, and honest.  I have experience both
  writing in such a way about numbers, and presenting those numbers in tables,
  charts, and graphs.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Technical Skills}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A Variety of Technical Skills}
  Owing largely to my carreer in IT which has included among its duities
  creating and maintaining technical documentation and source code, I am
  familiar with a variety of software and markup formats including
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Microsoft Word
    \item Libre Office
    \item git
    \item Mediawiki
    \item Markdown
    \item \LaTeX
    \item HTML and CSS
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{alertblock}{In fact\ldots}
    This presentation iteself is written in \LaTeX, and the source is available
    \href{http://github.com/werebus/ENGIN351-proposal}{on Github}.
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Rhetorical Awareness}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Aware of the Importance of the Rhetorical Situation}
  My instruction in technical writing has taught me that it is important to
  consider the content, the speaker, \emph{and} the audience before beginnning
  a piece of writing.  I will continue to exercise that skill in any writing
  performed for this project to ensure maximum effectiveness.
